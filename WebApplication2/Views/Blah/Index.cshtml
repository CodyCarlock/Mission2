<!--paragraph about what I want to get out of the class-->
<p>
    I hope to get a couple things out of IS413. The first is I want to learn a new programming language that can help me become a better IS professional
    <br />Another thing I want to get out of this class is to get better at applying my class room knowledge to problems I could face in the industry
    <br />The last thing I want to get out of this class is a better understnading of problem solving.
